rails-websocket-chat
====================

Chat server written in Ruby on Rails &amp; CoffeeScript with the help of [Dan Knox'](https://github.com/DanKnox) Ruby gem called [websocket-rails](https://github.com/DanKnox/websocket-rails). It's still pretty rough around the edges, but it's more to document my learning. Feel free to fork it or chat about better ways to do things.

I hope it'll be a helpful resource for those looking to get into websockets, CoffeeScript, and Ruby/Ruby on Rails. My goal is to use as much pure Ruby as possible. Clean & simple.

Upcoming Features:
==================

- Add a Redis & MongoDB database for saving & querying chats.
- Ability to change your screen name.
- DRYing the `ChatController` with `observers` or `before_filters'.
- RSpec tests for the Ruby, Jasmine specs for the JavaScript.
- Requests?
